3.1.
In the file "views.py" the "graphs" list is supposed to collect data for Prometheus; In all the cases, it just counts the number of each incident but for user's passwords, it also collects them. That's why the following part of the code was commented:
#        if pword not in graphs.keys():
#            graphs[pword] = Counter(f'counter_{pword}', 'The total number of '\
#              + f'times {pword} was used')

3.2.
Here again, I take advantage of the "graphs" by adding another key to it, "database_error_return_404. I then, searched the views.py text for "404" and incremented this counter every time there was a match in the code by adding the line: graphs["database_error_return_404"].inc()
